# Network-Intrusion-Detection
A network intrusion detection system is tasked with the crucial task of finding abnormal patterns of network flow that can  help the system protect the network from different types of attacks.

the codes has been divided into different notebooks based on the differernt parts of the experiment

part 0 : contains understanding the data and process it to have equal size of words and save different versions on it. 
part 1 : include the baseline models for Experiment 1 , 2 and 3 
part 2 : include the CNN classifiers for experiment 1 and 2 
part 3 : include the CNN with ML classsifiers for experiment 1 and 2 
part 4 : include the text CNN classifier for experiment 1 

since 

experiment 1 referes to the useage of only 5 words each represent by 100 embedded number.

experiment 2 referes to the useage of only 10 words each represent by 100 embedded number.

experiment 3 referes to the useage of only 25 words each represent by 100 embedded number. 


Note that : 
most of the models that have been developed in this project were saved and provided in its parts, with some models, the environment has finished without downloading the saved models.
